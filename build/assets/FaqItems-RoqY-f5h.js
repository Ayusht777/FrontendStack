      It's similar to challenges like 100 Days of Code, but specifically focused on component creation. 
      The website will showcase our components with live previews and code snippets, allowing you to see the implementation in action. 
      While there are no external prizes, the primary benefit is the significant improvement in our React.js and frontend development skills through practical experience with UI components.`,open:!0},{question:"Where will you be sharing the components you built?",answer:"We will share the components on this website, on GitHub, and in a post on LinkedIn."},{question:"How will the components be displayed on the website?",answer:`Each component will be showcased on the website with a live preview demonstrating its functionality.
       Additionally, we'll include the corresponding code snippet for each component, allowing users to see the implementation behind the scenes. 
       This provides a clear understanding of how the components work and how to use them in their own projects.`},{question:"Are there any specific design guidelines or best practices we are following for building the components?",answer:`Yes, we have specific design principles and accessibility guidelines. 
      You can refer to these resources for inspiration: [shadcn/ui], NextUI, GreatFrontEnd.`},{question:"What are the long-term plans for this project?",answer:`We plan to enhance this project in several ways:
            adding TypeScript Support, implementing Component Animations, and more. Stay tuned! You can follow our progress and see future plans for the project on GitHub.`},{question:"Is there a plan to document the learnings and outcomes of the challenge after it's completed?",answer:`Yes, we absolutely plan to document the learnings and outcomes of the challenge! 
    We believe it's valuable to share our experiences and insights to benefit ourselves and others.`},{question:"How can we participate in the challenge?",answer:`As of now, this is a private project where we showcase our creations. 
      However, we plan to open participation to more users in the future. Stay tuned!`},{question:"Are there any prizes for completing the challenge?",answer:`No, there are no external prizes for completing the challenge. 
      However, the primary benefit is the significant improvement in our frontend development skills through practical experience building reusable components.
       This can make us more competitive in job interviews and enhance our ability to tackle real-world frontend development projects.`},{question:"What is the timeframe for completing the challenge?",answer:`There's no specific target duration. We encourage a flexible approach, depending on our individual goals. 
      Whether you aim to build a few components quickly or take a more in-depth exploration, the challenge is designed to fit our individual learning pace.`}],p=({question:n,answer:o,open:i=!1})=>{const[t,s]=a.useState(i);return e.jsxs("div",{className:"my-4 w-full",children:[e.jsxs("button",{className:`flex w-full items-center justify-between  bg-Nav px-2 py-2.5 outline outline-1 outline-Border  ${t?"rounded-t-lg":"rounded-lg"}`,onClick:()=>s(!t),children:[e.jsx("p",{className:"w-full  font-semibold tracking-tight text-white  md:tracking-normal  text-left ",children:n}),e.jsx(r,{className:`text-Logo ${t?"rotate-180":""} transform duration-300 ease-in-out`})]}),e.jsx("ul",{className:`${t?"block":" hidden"} w-full text-white/90`,children:e.jsx("li",{className:"relative flex items-start rounded-b-lg bg-Nav px-2 py-1.5 leading-[1.55rem] outline outline-1 outline-Border",children:o})})]})};export{p as F,h as f};
